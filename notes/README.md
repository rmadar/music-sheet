## Time sub-divisions

How to count time sub-divisions for two most common schemes:
+  4th notes: `| 1   et   | 2   et   | 3   et   | 4   et   |`
+ 16th notes: `| 1 i a et | 2 i a et | 3 i a et | 4 i a et |`


## Music writing theory

 + *alteration*: increasing/decreasing a given note by 1/2 ton (can naturally appear in a given tonality, we then talk about "dieses a la cle")
 + *appogiature*: play a little note right before the main note
 + *staccato*: play brief notes (noted with a dot below/above the note)
 + *legato*: opposite from staccato, play sounds between each notes (noted with large horizontal brace)
 + *anacrouse*: starting before the first bar, with an incomplete bar


## Harmony/composition theory

 + *contre-point*: playing a high melody with an increasing pitch, while playing a pitch-decreasing mellide for the bass
 + *cadence*: progression of (at least two) chords with a specific tension-resolution goal.
 + *harmonisation*: going from a scale to chords (*.i.e.* how to group notes together)
 + *degree*: position of a given note/chords in a scale; each degree has a specfic harmonic role (tension, resolution, ...)
 + *tonic* (or *fondamental*): first degree of the scale
 + *dominant*: fifth degree (quinte) of the scale
 + *sub-tonic*: seventh degree (right before the tonic)
 + *sensible*: 1/2 ton below the tonic (can be the sub-tonic, or not depending on the interval between the 7th and 1st).
 + *cyle des quintes*: cadence going from 5th to 5th (assuming the precedent note is the tonic)
